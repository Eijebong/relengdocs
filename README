This repository has some of the more technical, and volatile internal
documentation for Firefox Release Engineering.

Rendered versions of the documentation may be viewed at:
  http://moz-releng-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

1. Create a python virtualenv

2. ``pip install -r rtfd-requirements.txt``

3. ``make html`` will build the docs locally and confirm that nothing in the toctree is broken. 
Verify any changes by viewing _build/html/index.html

Note: Any new docs should be directly or indirectly linked to from index.rst. (For example, if index.rst contains balrog/index.rst in its toctree, and the new doc is in the balrog/index.rst toctree, then the new doc is successfully indirectly linked.)
