finished jobs

When jobs complete, their information is stored into the status db.

Status of finished jobs is published to
http://builddata.pub.build.mozilla.org/buildjson/ from buildapi. Treeherder
consumes http://builddata.pub.build.mozilla.org/buildjson/builds-4hr.js.gz
to find when jobs have completed.
