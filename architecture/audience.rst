Audience
========

The audience for this chapter on architecture is releng contributors (including employees, of course).
This is not meant specifically for users of releng services or for the general public.

Architecture documentation is a great way to detect architectural bugs.
It can identify when a system's boundary isn't well-defined, as the text will repeat itself from system to system.
It can identify when a design lacks abstraction, as the description will be a tangle of caveats and special cases.

What to Include
---------------

Write short, narrative descriptions of how each system is designed.
